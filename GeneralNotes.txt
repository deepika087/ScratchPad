Write about the objective of your hack.
The objective of this project is to let users keep a track of their thoughts about various products so that they need not start from scratch
searching for the best products but can just resume from where they left the decision via previous notes
What you had dreamt of and what you have built.
I do not buy products in a single go. I generally prefer to search for the best product which can offer me 
a balance between cost, reviews and other such factors. So I generally forget what I did or what I thought last time I was browsing for a product 
in a category. So I have build a chrome extension specifically for Flipkart in this case which will help users to keep track of their thoughts
and later view them or search their custom notes.

Also mention how you plan to improve it beyond the hackathon
As of these notes are on the user localstorage the obvious extension of this project is to take this data on server and 
do apply NLP to understand what exactly does a customer want from a product.
