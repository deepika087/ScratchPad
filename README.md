# ScratchPad
This is a chrome extension for Flipkart which will help the user to keep track of their thoughts.

The objective of this project is to let users keep a track of their thoughts about various products which interest them so that they need not start from scratch for searching for the best products but can just resume from the point where they left the decision via their own notes.
Inspiration behind this project is that of my personal experience as I do not buy products in a single go. I generally prefer to search for the best product which can offer me a balance between cost, reviews and other such factors. Which sometimes require me to keep looking and comparing for even weeks. However I generally forget what I did or what I thought last time I was browsing for a product or the reason why I didn't shortlist it or why I did shortlist it. So I have build a chrome extension specifically for Flipkart(in this case) which will help users to keep track of their thoughts and later view or search in their custom notes.
The project has lot of future scope. As of now the notes are on user local storage the obvious extension of this project is to take this data on server and do apply NLP to understand what exactly does a customer want from a product.
